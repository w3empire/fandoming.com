            <p>Welcome to our electrifying rundown of the &ldquo;Top 22 Upcoming Switch Games of 2024 We Can&rsquo;t Wait to Play.&rdquo; Yes, you read that right - 2024 is going to be a bonanza of gaming goodness that&rsquo;ll probably have us glued to our screens and joy-con controllers like never before.</p>
<p>Picture this: You&rsquo;re cozied up on your couch, the smell of pizza in the air (because, let’s face it, gaming and pizza are the PB&amp;J of the culinary world), and your Switch in hand, ready to dive into a world of adventure, mystery, and, of course, those odd games that make you go, &ldquo;Who even thought of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, 2024 is not just another year; it&rsquo;s a portal to gaming nirvana, with titles so hot they&rsquo;d make a dragon wanna retire.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: Your social life is about to take a serious hit, but hey, who needs sunlight when you have a backlight, am I right? Let&rsquo;s get gaming!</p>

        <img data-src="https://fandoming.com/img/vVbKzvW-22_huc4f8570acf5836fef6aa1fe71799d91f_203875_32e7443c4344a5757ab3377006910d25.png" alt="Top 22 Upcoming Switch Games of 2024 We Can&#39;t Wait to Play" title="Top 22 Upcoming Switch Games of 2024 We Can&#39;t Wait to Play" class="lazy-img">

<p>Let&rsquo;s kick off our list with a gem that&rsquo;s got me super excited: &ldquo;Unicorn Overlord.&rdquo; Set to release on March 8, 2024, this game is shaping up to be something special. Here&rsquo;s the scoop on why you should be as hyped as I am.</p>
<p>First off, &ldquo;Unicorn Overlord&rdquo; is the brainchild of ATLUS and Vanillaware, the same geniuses behind hits like &ldquo;13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim&rdquo; and &ldquo;Odin Sphere&rdquo;. That&rsquo;s a pedigree that promises quality and innovative gameplay, right?</p>
<p>Now, the game itself? It&rsquo;s a tactical RPG that&rsquo;s all about overworld exploration and a fresh battle system, all wrapped up in that iconic Vanillaware style. I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about traversing a vibrant world, assembling units, and directing them into beautifully animated battles.</p>
<p>How cool is that? You get to perform heroic deeds and grow your renown across five different nations.</p>
<p>The setting is a royal adventure where you fight against fate to reclaim your reign, alongside allies you can trust.</p>
<p>The whole concept gives me chills! It&rsquo;s like stepping into a storybook with a twist of strategy and action. And with the game being presented at the September 2023 Nintendo Direct, you know it&rsquo;s got that Nintendo seal of quality and excitement.</p>

<p>Now, this isn&rsquo;t just any underwater adventure. Imagine a world beneath the waves that&rsquo;s a little quirky, a bit challenging, and totally engaging. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re getting with this game, and I&rsquo;m here to tell you why it&rsquo;s making waves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another Crab&rsquo;s Treasure&rdquo; is developed by Aggro Crab, known for their unique and often humorous approach to game design. Set for release in early 2024, this game is a blend of wackiness and adventure that promises a truly one-of-a-kind experience.</p>
<p>You play as Kril, a hermit crab with a mission. Picture this: your home (a.k.a. your shell) has been repossessed.</p>
<p>Yep, you heard that right! Now, you&rsquo;re on an epic treasure hunt in a stunning underwater kingdom, but here&rsquo;s the twist – you&rsquo;re wearing trash as armor! It&rsquo;s a literal case of one crab&rsquo;s trash being another crab&rsquo;s treasure.</p>
<p>This game isn&rsquo;t just about the hunt; it&rsquo;s about survival in an ocean filled with enemies way bigger than you.</p>
<p>The game&rsquo;s world is intriguing, described as a &ldquo;crumbling underwater kingdom.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s a mysterious curse, pollution, and you&rsquo;ve even got the Duchess after you for neglecting to pay your property taxes on your shell – talk about underwater politics!</p>
<p>This setting provides a rich backdrop for an adventure that&rsquo;s both humorous and thought-provoking.</p>

<p>But what makes &ldquo;Picross S+&rdquo; stand out? This isn&rsquo;t just a new Picross game; it&rsquo;s a compilation of past Picross releases. Yes, you heard that right – it&rsquo;s like a greatest hits album for Picross! This title includes all nine 3DS Picross e releases that Jupiter distributed via the 3DS eShop.</p>
<p>Imagine having all that puzzle goodness in one place, ready to play on your Switch.</p>
<p>For those new to Picross, here&rsquo;s the deal: It&rsquo;s a puzzle game where you use numbers as hints to complete illustrations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s simple to learn but can be devilishly challenging. And with &ldquo;Picross S+,&rdquo; you&rsquo;re not just getting a single game – you&rsquo;re getting a remaster of the original Picross E game, with the other eight releases available as DLC.</p>
<p>This means a seemingly endless supply of puzzles to keep your brain buzzing.</p>
<h2 id="19-princess-peach-showtime"><span class='item-number'>19</span><span class='item-title'>Princess Peach: Showtime</span></h2><figure>

<p>&ldquo;Princess Peach: Showtime!&rdquo; is set to hit the Switch on March 22, 2024. This game is all about our favorite Mushroom Kingdom royalty stepping into the limelight as the main protagonist. And let me tell you, it&rsquo;s about time!</p>
<p>The big reveal came during the September 2023 Nintendo Direct, following a teaser earlier that June. The hype has been building ever since, and for a good reason.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just talking about a side character getting her own game; we&rsquo;re talking about Princess Peach, a character who&rsquo;s been a staple of the Mario universe since practically the beginning.</p>
<p>But what&rsquo;s the game about? So, here is the deal: Peach receives an invitation to the Sparkle Theater. Sounds charming, right? But, as you might expect in the Mushroom Kingdom, things go sideways pretty quickly. Enter the main antagonist, the mysterious Wicked Grape, and his crew, the Sour Bunch. It seems they&rsquo;ve got their sights set on causing trouble, and it&rsquo;s up to Peach to save the day.</p>
<figure>
        <img data-src="https://fandoming.com/img/qldfYaOztW_hucee29195601857d5c45661140e32ca16_1276073_949f3c14e3cf254e285e3a9970b33e90.png" alt="Top 22 Upcoming Switch Games of 2024 We Can&#39;t Wait to Play" title="Top 22 Upcoming Switch Games of 2024 We Can&#39;t Wait to Play" class="lazy-img">
    </figure>
<p>The setting of &ldquo;Princess Peach: Showtime&rdquo; is what really piques my interest. The game takes place in the Sparkle Theater, a location that&rsquo;s both glamorous and fraught with danger. But Peach isn&rsquo;t alone in this adventure.</p>
<p>She teams up with the theater’s guardian, Stella, to reclaim the spotlight and, more importantly, save the day. And here&rsquo;s a fun twist: with Stella&rsquo;s help, Peach can switch into different styles or modes, adding a fresh layer to gameplay and strategy.</p>
<p>This game marks the first time since &ldquo;Super Princess Peach&rdquo; (2005) that Peach is the star of her own show. It&rsquo;s a big deal, not just for Peach fans, but for anyone who&rsquo;s been following the Mario series over the years.</p>
<p>The focus on Peach in a leading role, especially in an action-adventure format, opens up a whole new realm of possibilities for storytelling and gameplay within the Mario universe.</p>

If you loved the previous games, you&rsquo;re in for a real treat with this one. Let&rsquo;s delve into what makes &ldquo;Cat Quest III&rdquo; a must-play on our list.</p>
<p>The setting of &ldquo;Cat Quest III&rdquo; is really cool. We&rsquo;re talking about the Purribean archipelago, a place where Pi-rats are on the prowl, searching for a mythical treasure called the Northern Star.</p>
<p>You get to sail the seas in your own ship, and the world is yours to explore. You can visit various areas, meet interesting characters, and take on quests in any order you like. Talk about freedom and adventure!</p>
<p>This time, the game takes the cute and accessible action RPG to the high seas. That&rsquo;s right, we&rsquo;re not just roaming the lands; we&rsquo;re navigating the waters. And if the idea of being a swashbuckling cat on a quest doesn’t excite you, I don&rsquo;t know what will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cat Quest III&rdquo; is described as a 2.5D open-world action RPG, which sounds like it&rsquo;s going to offer a visually stunning and immersive experience.</p>
<p>The game promises even more paw-some adventures, and from the looks of it, it&rsquo;s going to deliver just that. Can you imagine roaming around a beautifully crafted world filled with furry friends and foes, all while unraveling the mysteries of the Purribean? Sign me up!</p>

<p>The legendary &ldquo;Prince of Persia&rdquo; series is making a grand comeback with &ldquo;Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown,&rdquo; set to release on January 18, 2024.</p>
<p>Developed and published by Ubisoft, this game is the first major installment in the series since 2010&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&rdquo; represents a significant evolution in the series. It is a 2.5D side-scrolling action-adventure platform game, bringing a fresh perspective to the classic franchise.</p>
<p>The game features a new protagonist, Sargon, who possesses the agility and combat prowess typical of the series&rsquo; heroes. Players will navigate through the game&rsquo;s world, using Sargon&rsquo;s abilities to jump, slide, and air dash between platforms, as well as engage in combat using a pair of blades.</p>

    </figure>
<p>One thing about this game that stands out for me is Sargon&rsquo;s unique abilities, including time-based powers that add a strategic element to both combat and platforming.</p>
<p>For instance, the &ldquo;Rush of the Simurgh&rdquo; allows Sargon to instantly dash forward through time, while the &ldquo;Shadow of the Simurgh&rdquo; creates a temporary checkpoint. These abilities, along with talismans that alter Sargon&rsquo;s capabilities, offer dynamic and varied gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>Incorporating elements commonly found in Metroidvania video games, &ldquo;The Lost Crown&rdquo; includes an interconnected game world filled with shortcuts, secret rooms, and various puzzles.</p>
<p>This design encourages exploration and problem-solving, enriching the player&rsquo;s experience. Time crystals scattered throughout the world can be collected to purchase new upgrades for Sargon&rsquo;s weapons, adding another layer of depth to the game.</p>
<p>The game also allows players to pin screenshots to the map, helping them keep track of unsolved puzzles and areas to revisit, enhancing the exploratory aspect.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kingdom Come: Deliverance&rdquo; is finally making its way to the Nintendo Switch in early 2024! This medieval action RPG, first launched in 2018, is getting a royal treatment with its Switch port, and let me tell you, it&rsquo;s been worth the wait.</p>
<p>The Switch port of &ldquo;Kingdom Come: Deliverance&rdquo; is being handled by Saber Interactive. These are the same folks who worked magic on &ldquo;The Witcher III: Wild Hunt&rdquo; for the hybrid console.</p>
<p>So, we&rsquo;ve got some solid hands on deck here, promising a quality port that should hopefully iron out any performance kinks from the original releases on PS4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kingdom Come: Deliverance&rdquo; is set in the year 1403, during the rule of King Wenceslaus IV in Bohemia. You step into the shoes of Henry, a blacksmith&rsquo;s son, whose life turns upside down when the war knocks on his doorstep.</p>
<p>This game is big on realism – think one-on-one combat, the need to maintain your hygiene, manage hunger and even deal with the aftermath of a wild night out. Yep, it&rsquo;s like stepping into a time machine, minus the risk of actual bodily harm!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kingdom Come: Deliverance&rdquo; comes packed with features that make it perfect for a portable gaming experience on the Switch. We&rsquo;re talking about a massive, realistic open world filled with majestic castles, vast fields, and lush forests.</p>
<p>The story is non-linear, allowing you to solve quests in multiple ways and face the consequences of your decisions. Combat is challenging and rewarding, with options for distance, stealth, or melee engagements.</p>
<p>And character development? It&rsquo;s all about improving skills, earning perks, and upgrading your equipment.</p>
<p>But here&rsquo;s the royal icing on the cake: the Switch version will be the &ldquo;Royal Edition,&rdquo; including all the DLCs released for the game.</p>
<p>That means &ldquo;Treasures of the Past,&rdquo; &ldquo;From the Ashes,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Amorous Adventures of Bold Sir Hans Capon,&rdquo; &ldquo;Band of Bastards,&rdquo; and &ldquo;A Woman&rsquo;s Lot&rdquo; will be available from day one.</p>
<p>So, not only are you getting the base game, but you&rsquo;re also getting a treasure trove of additional content to enhance your medieval escapades.</p>

<p>While details are still emerging, the anticipation is built around the promise of an epic narrative, strategic gameplay, and a world rich in lore and character.</p>

<p>Remember the good old 2004 Game Boy Advance game? Well, this is a complete remake of that classic, and it&rsquo;s the first &ldquo;Mario vs. Donkey Kong&rdquo; game for the Switch, reviving the series after nearly a decade since &ldquo;Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Alright, let&rsquo;s get into the juicy details. This isn&rsquo;t just any remake – it&rsquo;s a total overhaul. We&rsquo;re talking full 3D models instead of pre-rendered sprites, bringing the game right into the modern era of gaming.</p>
