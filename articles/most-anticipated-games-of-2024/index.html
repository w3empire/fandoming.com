<p>From action-packed adventures to immersive RPGs, there&rsquo;s something for everyone.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a sneak peek at the top 20 games you should be hyped about!</p>
<h2 id="20-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown">20. Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</h2>
<figure>
        <img data-src="https://fandoming.com/img/MNyByWYHb-20_huf31bfbb6ff32d6c1334788e296721187_224455_07e04a6abea56ed914231f2e340fd015.png" alt="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" title="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" class="lazy-img">
    </figure>
<p>&ldquo;Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown&rdquo; is making a grand return, reviving the classic series with a fresh twist. Developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the Rayman series, this game is set to release on January 18, 2024.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a 2.5D platform action-adventure game that introduces us to a new hero, Sargon, a member of The Immortals warrior clan. Your mission? To rescue the kidnapped Prince Ghassan in the cursed city of Mount Qaf.</p>
<p>This title stands out with its side-scrolling action-adventure gameplay, allowing Sargon to showcase his agility and combat prowess.</p>
<p>A mix of quick platforming actions like jumping, sliding, and air dashing, combined with strategic combat elements, makes for a thrilling experience. Special time-based powers and various puzzles add depth to the gameplay, typical of Metroidvania games.</p>
<p>Expect interconnected worlds, hidden rooms, and time crystals that unlock new weapon upgrades.</p>
<p>The game&rsquo;s narrative is deeply rooted in Persian mythology, with a modern touch in its visual design, aiming to bring a fresh perspective to the franchise. The time powers from &ldquo;The Sands of Time&rdquo; series make a comeback, but with a twist - they are used by the game&rsquo;s antagonist, not Sargon.</p>
<p>The artistic direction promises to deliver high-quality graphics and immersive cinematics, all running smoothly at 60 fps on all platforms.</p>
<p>Ubisoft is not just reviving a beloved series; they&rsquo;re reimagining it for a new generation, blending traditional elements with modern design and storytelling.</p>

<p>The game is exclusive to next-gen platforms, including PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, showcasing why it&rsquo;s not available on older consoles like Xbox One or PS4.</p>
<p>Set in Metropolis, it thrusts players into an alien invasion led by Brainiac, who has brainwashed the Justice League, turning them against humanity.</p>
<p>The game features four playable characters - Deadshot, Harley Quinn, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark - each with unique abilities and skill trees.</p>

<p>This crisis leaves you battling for survival in a labyrinth of realms filled with beauty and danger.</p>
<p>The game explores the relationship between humans and the Fae, a magical race that has significantly influenced human civilization.</p>

<p>In &ldquo;The Final Shape,&rdquo; players will find themselves at the crux of the ultimate showdown with The Witness, a character poised on the brink of victory.</p>
<p>An intriguing aspect of the expansion is the mysterious return of Cayde-6, a beloved character, adding a layer of suspense and excitement. This expansion is set to host the biggest battle in Destiny 2&rsquo;s history, taking place within the enigmatic structures of the Traveler itself.</p>
<p>The expansion will introduce several new gameplay features and systems. Players can look forward to new Exotics, weapon upgrades, and a revamped post-launch structure.</p>
<p>The Final Shape will also bring an episodic approach to storytelling, aiming to provide a more continuous and engaging narrative experience.</p>
<h2 id="16-homeworld-3">16. Homeworld 3</h2>
<figure>
        <img data-src="https://fandoming.com/img/MNyByWYHb-16_hu0cf632b2bf130c50aea58b29ff08febe_439660_8b98d531d87419526e0d9393c4b3ec72.png" alt="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" title="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" class="lazy-img">
    </figure>
<p>&ldquo;Homeworld 3&rdquo;, set for release on March 8, 2024, is the long-awaited sequel in the acclaimed Homeworld series, renowned for its real-time strategy gameplay set in space.</p>
<p>Developed by Blackbird Interactive, which includes veterans from the original Homeworld games, this title promises to expand on the series&rsquo; legacy with modern technological enhancements.</p>
<p>The narrative of Homeworld 3 unfolds a century after the events of Homeworld 2, marking a new chapter in humanity&rsquo;s interstellar journey. This era, described as a golden age for humanity, is threatened by a mysterious force known as the Anomaly, spreading across the cosmos.</p>
<p>The game’s campaign centers around Imogen S&rsquo;Jet, the successor to Karan S&rsquo;Jet, as she holds the key to unraveling the mysteries threatening the galaxy&rsquo;s future.</p>
<p>Homeworld 3 remains faithful to the series&rsquo; roots in real-time space strategy, allowing players to command fleets of spaceships across a three-dimensional plane. Strategic positioning in galactic sectors is crucial due to the realistic ballistics system, where line of sight and cover are vital.</p>
<p>Players must manage their fleet judiciously, as it persists from mission to mission, making the conservation of ships and resources a key element of strategy.</p>
<h2 id="15-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">15. Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines 2</h2>
<figure>
        <img data-src="https://fandoming.com/img/MNyByWYHb-15_hua357835b020d6fe1a5cc510ddff6ce9a_239997_73362ba7fdcb6c1014e3ee29f25031d4.png" alt="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" title="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" class="lazy-img">
    </figure>
<p>&ldquo;Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2,&rdquo; has undergone a significant development journey. Originally pitched in 2016 by developer Hardsuit Labs and writer Brian Mitsoda, the game experienced multiple delays and a change in development teams.</p>
<p>Paradox Interactive, the game&rsquo;s publisher, parted ways with Hardsuit Labs due to differing visions for the final product and later handed the project to The Chinese Room, known for narrative-driven games like &ldquo;Dear Esther&rdquo; and &ldquo;Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The vision for &ldquo;Bloodlines 2&rdquo; under The Chinese Room involves capturing the player fantasy of being a vampire in a video game and faithfully representing &ldquo;Vampire: The Masquerade 5th Edition.&rdquo; The game&rsquo;s protagonist is now an elder vampire new to Seattle, as opposed to a newly formed Thinblood vampire.</p>
<p>This shift accompanies an upgrade from Unreal Engine 4 to Unreal Engine 5. Gameplay remains first-person, with various combat options and abilities adapted from the RPG.</p>
<p>Players must maintain the Masquerade, avoiding exposing their vampire identity in public, with narrative consequences for breaches.</p>
<h2 id="14-ark-2">14. Ark 2</h2>
<figure>
        <img data-src="https://fandoming.com/img/MNyByWYHb-14_hu2f6ad287c2c644b81521984df84e18e7_575690_465f6bf24d3690a419cf860f4901f920.png" alt="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" title="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" class="lazy-img">
    </figure>
<p>&ldquo;Ark 2,&rdquo; initially set for release in 2023, has been delayed to late 2024. This sequel to the popular survival game &ldquo;Ark: Survival Evolved&rdquo; is being developed by Studio Wildcard and will be available on PC, Xbox Series S/X, and Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>The game&rsquo;s development journey has been complex, with the team deciding to delay the release to ensure they can deliver the best possible experience.</p>
<p>This decision also aligns with the game being developed on Unreal Engine 5, a powerful but relatively new toolset for the developers. They need more time to understand and leverage this engine effectively to make &ldquo;Ark 2&rdquo; as good as it can be.</p>
<p>In the meantime, to appease fans and provide a next-gen Ark experience, Studio Wildcard announced the release of &ldquo;Ark: Survival Ascended,&rdquo; a remastered version of the original game using Unreal Engine 5. This remaster is scheduled for release in August and will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series S/X.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ark: Survival Ascended&rdquo; will feature significant updates and improvements over the first game, including a dynamic water system, interactive foliage, performance gains, and cross-platform multiplayer and modding capabilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ark 2&rdquo; itself is expected to undergo some significant design changes from the original game. These include a focus on &ldquo;Souls-like&rdquo; combat, primitive-only weaponry, and strict third-person mechanics. The game is also said to adopt a &lsquo;very serious&rsquo; tone, differentiating it from its predecessor.</p>
<h2 id="13-palworld">13. Palworld</h2>
<figure>
        <img data-src="https://fandoming.com/img/MNyByWYHb-13_hu3e78ccd1dfd2cd874648bc8bd95d6ed5_396708_d9bce9d2d0020d76c1460d71aabb87c3.png" alt="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" title="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" class="lazy-img">
    </figure>
<p>&ldquo;Palworld,&rdquo; set to release into early access in January 2024, is an open-world game that combines creature collection with a unique and somewhat surreal twist. The game, developed by Pocketpair, is often described as &ldquo;Pokémon with guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Players can befriend and collect various creatures, known as Pals, in an expansive world. However, unlike traditional creature collection games, &ldquo;Palworld&rdquo; allows players to engage in armed combat alongside their Pals.</p>
<p>The gameplay involves traditional elements like catching Pals using specially designed spheres, breeding to create powerful variations, and pitting Pals against each other to strengthen them.</p>
<p>Also, the game incorporates survival and crafting mechanics, requiring players and their Pals to gather resources for survival. You can expect to navigate through diverse environments, ranging from arctic landscapes to active volcanoes.</p>
<h2 id="12-black-myth-wukong">12. Black Myth: Wukong</h2>

    </figure>
<p>&ldquo;Black Myth: Wukong&rdquo; is an action RPG scheduled for release on August 20, 2024. Developed by Game Science, the game is highly anticipated due to its stunning visual presentation and gameplay based on Chinese mythology.</p>
<p>It draws inspiration from the classic 16th-century Chinese novel &ldquo;Journey to the West,&rdquo; and features a unique, visually striking world filled with diverse and fantastical creatures.</p>
<p>In &ldquo;Black Myth: Wukong,&rdquo; players assume the role of the titular character, Wukong, who is a monkey-like figure with extraordinary combat abilities.</p>
<p>The game&rsquo;s setting and character design stand out for their departure from traditional western fantasy tropes, incorporating elements from eastern mythology and folklore.</p>
<p>The gameplay is described as Soulslike, a term that refers to games inspired by the &ldquo;Dark Souls&rdquo; series, known for their challenging combat and intricate world design.</p>
<p>This means players can expect intricate combat mechanics requiring skillful timing and strategy, particularly in battles against the game&rsquo;s numerous enemies, which range from animalistic creatures to demonic entities.</p>
<h2 id="11-the-wolf-among-us-2">11. The Wolf Among Us 2</h2>

    </figure>
<p>&ldquo;The Wolf Among Us 2&rdquo; is an upcoming episodic graphic adventure game, set to release in 2024. Developed and published by Telltale Games with the assistance of AdHoc Studio, the game is a sequel to the 2013 title &ldquo;The Wolf Among Us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The narrative continues six months after the events of the first game. This sequel promises to further explore the noir world of fairytale characters living in our reality, with players once again stepping into the shoes of Bigby, “The Big Bad Wolf” and Sheriff of Fabletown.</p>
<p>The game has seen a turbulent development history. Initially, Telltale Games planned a second season after completing the first game in 2014 but had to delay due to other projects.</p>
<p>Despite announcing the sequel in 2017 for a 2018 release, internal studio issues led to its postponement.</p>
<p>The situation was further complicated by Telltale&rsquo;s majority studio closure in 2018, which led to the cancellation of several projects, including this sequel.</p>
<h2 id="10-blue-protocol">10. Blue Protocol</h2>

        <img data-src="https://fandoming.com/img/MNyByWYHb-10_hu220ba1eae2b0a1ae8cba0b4bab9a89f7_1453799_78c26f4001698a0ca9405d374df7239f.png" alt="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" title="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" class="lazy-img">

<p>Set in the futuristic world of Regnas, which faces impending destruction due to an overreliance on technology, &ldquo;Blue Protocol&rdquo; offers a rich narrative. Players embark on a quest to uncover the truth behind their origins and confront their destiny.</p>
<p>The game features extensive character customization, dynamic combat, and a focus on both solo and multiplayer gameplay, including raids and dungeons.</p>
<p>Five playable classes will be available at launch: Blade Warden, Keen Strider, Spell Weaver, Twin Striker, and Foe Breaker, each offering unique abilities and playstyles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blue Protocol&rdquo; has been designed with a controller-first approach, although it will also support keyboard and mouse controls.</p>
<h2 id="9-star-wars-outlaws">9. Star Wars Outlaws</h2>
<figure>
        <img data-src="https://fandoming.com/img/MNyByWYHb-9_hu84edc2826fe9f373052e08dd28ef9acf_365758_a2e8dbcc642fecb5406604b3d243a839.png" alt="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" title="Top 20 Most Anticipated Games of 2024 Ranked (Our Picks)" class="lazy-img">
