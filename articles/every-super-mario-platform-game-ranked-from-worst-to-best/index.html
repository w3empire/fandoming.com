<p>Oh, yeah! The mustachioed plumber who’s become more iconic than sliced bread. If you’ve ever held a game controller, chances are you&rsquo;ve experienced the joy of a Mario game.</p>
<p>But with so many titles, which reigns supreme? Let&rsquo;s take a whimsical, nostalgia-laden dive into the world of Super Mario platform games, ranking them from the ones that made us frown a little to those that had us grinning ear to ear.</p>
<h2 id="19-super-mario-bros-2-1988">19. Super Mario Bros. 2 (1988)</h2>
<figure>
        <img data-src="https://fandoming.com/img/rviTCYypp-19_hub22d2fbf9b00fa5fd8672f46151b0c47_644001_e11aa3c951852f86b588a51c3878a237.png" alt="Every Super Mario Platform Game Ranked from Worst to Best" title="Every Super Mario Platform Game Ranked from Worst to Best" class="lazy-img"><figcaption>Luigi embarks on a retro aquatic adventure, leaping over challenges in the iconic Water World of the Super Mario series. — Image: Nintendo</figcaption>

<p>&ldquo;Super Mario Bros. 2&rdquo; is the quirky cousin in the Mario family. Released in 1988, it flipped the script with its unique gameplay mechanics.</p>
<p>Remember throwing turnips at enemies? What a trip! While it strayed from the classic formula, it was like that weird dish at a family dinner—unfamiliar but oddly satisfying.</p>
<p>Its distinct style, from floating princesses to potion doors, made it memorable. Though it&rsquo;s not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea, &ldquo;Super Mario Bros. 2&rdquo; is like that odd song you can’t help but hum now and then.</p>
<p class="hl">This game was originally released in Japan as &ldquo;Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic&rdquo; and was later adapted into a Mario game for Western audiences, explaining its unique gameplay and character choices.</p>

    </figure>
<p>Next up, &ldquo;Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels.&rdquo; Known as the &ldquo;too tough for TV&rdquo; version of Mario, this 1986 title was basically the original game&rsquo;s evil twin. The level design? Brutal.</p>
<p>The challenge? Immense. Playing this game was like trying to solve a Rubik&rsquo;s cube blindfolded. It&rsquo;s a relentless test of skill and patience, but for those who conquered it, the bragging rights were unparalleled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lost Levels&rdquo; is like that hardcore workout you begrudgingly respect for its sheer intensity.</p>
<p class="hl">Known in Japan as &ldquo;Super Mario Bros. 2,&rdquo; this game was deemed too difficult for Western players at the time, leading to the creation of a different &ldquo;Super Mario Bros. 2&rdquo; for the international market.</p>

<h2 id="17-new-super-mario-bros-2006">17. New Super Mario Bros. (2006)</h2>

<p>&ldquo;New Super Mario Bros.&rdquo; was a nostalgia bomb with a modern twist. It took us back to the 2D roots but dressed in fancy, modern graphics.</p>
<p>Recall the first time you got the Mega Mushroom and felt invincible? Pure joy. The game merged old-school charm with new-age flair, like a classic car with a fresh paint job.</p>
<p>It was a delightful reminder of why we fell in love with Mario in the first place, blending the past and present beautifully.</p>
<p class="hl">This game marked the return of the Mario series to 2D platforming after a decade of 3D titles, revitalizing the classic gameplay style with modern graphics.</p>

<h2 id="16-super-mario-land-1989">16. Super Mario Land (1989)</h2>

<p>Mario&rsquo;s first handheld adventure, &ldquo;Super Mario Land,&rdquo; was like carrying a piece of childhood in your pocket.</p>
<p>Released in 1989 for the Game Boy, it brought the charm of Mario into a portable format. Sure, it was different—Mario in a submarine? But these quirks made it memorable.</p>
<p>It’s the kind of game you’d play under the covers with a flashlight, way past your bedtime. Simple, charming, and a testament to the time when gaming on the go was a novel concept.</p>
<p class="hl">Unlike other Mario games, &ldquo;Super Mario Land&rdquo; was not created by Mario’s creator, Shigeru Miyamoto. Instead, it was developed by Gunpei Yokoi, the creator of the Game Boy.</p>

<h2 id="15-super-mario-land-2-6-golden-coins-1992">15. Super Mario Land 2: 6 Golden Coins (1992)</h2>
